## "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley

A dystopian novel set in a futuristic World State of genetically modified citizens and an intelligence-based social hierarchy.

## "1984" by George Orwell

This is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale. Thematically, "Nineteen Eighty-Four" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society.

## "Dune" by Frank Herbert

Set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs, "Dune" tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "the spice," a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities.
