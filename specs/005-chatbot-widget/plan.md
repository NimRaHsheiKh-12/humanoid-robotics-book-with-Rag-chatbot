# Implementation Plan: Website Chatbot Widget

**Branch**: `005-chatbot-widget` | **Date**: 2025-12-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

This plan outlines the technical approach for implementing a futuristic, floating chatbot widget on the Humanoid Robotics Book website. The widget will be implemented using React and TypeScript within the existing Docusaurus framework. The plan resolves current ambiguities around the testing strategy by proposing the adoption of Jest and React Testing Library. It also defines the data model for chat messages, the API contract for backend communication, and the file structure for the new components.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.6.2, React 19, Docusaurus 3.9.2
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Docusaurus, @chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react
**Storage**: N/A (State managed in React components)
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Resolved in [research.md](research.md))
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web Application (Docusaurus Frontend + Python Backend)
**Constraints**: Must not cause content-shifting on the page. Animations should be smooth (<500ms).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **UI/UX Excellence**: Does the plan prioritize a visually stunning, modern, and futuristic UI? Is the UX smooth, clean, and intuitive? (Yes, the spec emphasizes this, and component-based implementation allows for focused styling).
- **Innovative Design**: Does the plan avoid a standard "docs website" look? Does it include a unique, memorable design, especially for the landing page? (Yes, the "futuristic" and "premium" keywords from the spec guide the design).
- **Seamless Chatbot Integration**: Does the plan include a floating chatbot that doesn't cause content shifting? (Yes, the plan is to use fixed positioning to overlay the chat widget).
- **Internationalization**: Does the plan account for supporting English and Urdu? (Yes, the Docusaurus i18n setup is already in place).
- **Code Quality**: Does the plan emphasize clean, well-structured, and maintainable code? (Yes, by following the established project structure).

```

### Source Code (repository root)

The project follows a hybrid structure with a Docusaurus frontend and a Python backend. New components will be created within the existing frontend structure.

```text
my-humanoid-book/
├── backend/
│   └── ... (existing Python backend)
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Chatbot/        # New Component Directory
│   │       ├── index.tsx
│   │       ├── Chatbot.css
│   │       └── FloatingIcon.tsx
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── index.tsx       # To be modified to include the chatbot
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

**Structure Decision**: The plan utilizes the existing project structure. New, self-contained chatbot components will be created in `my-humanoid-book/src/components/Chatbot/` to ensure modularity and separation of concerns.

## Complexity Tracking
No constitutional violations to justify.
