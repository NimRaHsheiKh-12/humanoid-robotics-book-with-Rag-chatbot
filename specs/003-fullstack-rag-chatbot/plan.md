# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.9+, TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, ChromaDB, Google Gemini API, LangChain, Docusaurus, React, ChatKit
**Storage**: ChromaDB (vector store)
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Real-time streaming of chat responses.
**Constraints**: Must be self-contained and easy to run locally.
**Scale/Scope**: A single-page chatbot application within a Docusaurus site.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **UI/UX Excellence**: Does the plan prioritize a visually stunning, modern, and futuristic UI? Is the UX smooth, clean, and intuitive?
- **Innovative Design**: Does the plan avoid a standard "docs website" look? Does it include a unique, memorable design, especially for the landing page?
- **Seamless Chatbot Integration**: Does the plan include a floating chatbot that doesn't cause content shifting?
- **Internationalization**: Does the plan account for supporting English and Urdu?
- **Code Quality**: Does the plan emphasize clean, well-structured, and maintainable code?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
