## Prompt

/sp.implement

## Response snapshot

I cannot proceed with the implementation at this time because the `tasks.md` file is missing for the feature `001-docusaurus-ui-ux`.

Please run `/sp.tasks` first to generate the task list before attempting to implement.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified missing tasks.md, preventing implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run.
- 📁 Files: No new files created or modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User needs to run `/sp.tasks`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The /sp.implement command correctly identified the missing tasks.md file as a prerequisite.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Missing prerequisite file.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure all prerequisite files are generated by prior commands.
