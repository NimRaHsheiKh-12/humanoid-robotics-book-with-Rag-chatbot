# Humanoid Robotics Book Website UI Constitution

## Foundations

### Purpose
To guide the creation of a hackathon-level website UI for a humanoid robotics book, with a focus on creating a standout project that feels different, memorable, and professional.

### Scope
The project includes the design and implementation of a visually stunning, modern, and futuristic website. The website will feature a landing page that feels like a product launch, content pages for the book, and a unique chatbot experience.

### Author Style
Maintain a style that is eye-catching, premium, and unique, with a focus on creativity, visualization, and the "wow-factor".

## Principles

### UI/UX Excellence
The user interface and experience must be the top priority. The UI must be visually stunning, modern, and futuristic. The UX must be smooth, clean, and intuitive, with no content shifting when interactive elements like the chatbot are used.

### Innovative Design
The website must not look like a normal documentation website. The design should be unique and memorable. The landing page, in particular, should have the feel of a product launch.

### Seamless Chatbot Integration
The chatbot must behave like a real website chat widget, floating on the screen rather than being a side panel. The integration should be seamless and not disrupt the user experience.

### Internationalization
The website must be designed to support multiple languages, starting with English and Urdu, to ensure it is accessible to a wider audience.

### Code Quality
The code must be clean, well-structured, and maintainable, even in a hackathon environment.

## Governance

### Amendments
Any updates to the book structure or content require documentation and review.

### Pull Requests & Reviews
Verify compliance with the Constitution in all edits or additions.

### Complexity Justification
Any complex topic or section must be clearly explained and justified.

## Runtime Guidance

### Reference
Always follow the principles outlined in this constitution.

### Safety
Ensure a safe and positive user experience.
