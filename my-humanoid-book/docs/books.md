# Introduction to Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robotics is a fascinating field dedicated to creating robots that mimic human form and behavior. These robots are designed to interact with human environments, assist in various tasks, and even serve as companions.

## Key Components

Humanoid robots typically consist of:
-   **Actuators**: Motors that enable movement.
-   **Sensors**: Devices that perceive the environment (e.g., cameras, touch sensors).
-   **Control Systems**: Software that processes sensor data and controls actuators.
-   **Power Source**: Batteries or external power supply.

## Applications

Humanoid robots have potential applications in:
-   **Healthcare**: Assisting the elderly or disabled.
-   **Education**: Interactive teaching tools.
-   **Exploration**: Operating in environments dangerous for humans.
-   **Entertainment**: Performing in shows or acting as interactive exhibits.
